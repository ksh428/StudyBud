A website for programmers to connect and discuss various Programming topics by creating / joining a Room (having a particular topic) and post or discuss/comment on posts.
Implemented using Django and SQLite database using best practices like authentication, django messages etc. Also implemented a simple API endpoint using REST Freamework 
to get list of  all rooms and information about a particular room.Users will need to authenticate to do any activate in the website however viewing anything will not require 
authentication.
